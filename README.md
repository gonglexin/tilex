# tilex - Today I Learned in Elixir

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hashrocket/tilex.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hashrocket/tilex)

> tilex is an open-source project by the team at
> [Hashrocket](https://hashrocket.com/) that catalogues the sharing &
> accumulation of knowledge as it happens day-to-day. Posts have a 200-word
> limit, and posting is open to any Rocketeer as well as select friends of the
> team. We hope you enjoy learning along with us.

This site was open-sourced as a window into our development process, as well as
to allow people to experiment with the site on their own and contribute to the
project.

We originally implemented _tilex_ as
[_hr-til_](https://github.com/hashrocket/hr-til), a Ruby on Rails app.

### Installation

If you are creating your own version of the site,
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.

Then install the [Phoenix
Dependencies](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation) as well as
PostgreSQL.

Next, follow these setup steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/tilex
$ cd tilex
$ mix deps.get
$ mix ecto.create
$ mix ecto.migrate
$ npm install
$ mix phoenix.server
```

Optionally, seed the database with:

```
$ mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### Testing

Wallaby relies on PhantomJS, install it:

```
$ npm install -g phantomjs
```

Run the tests with:

```
$ mix text
```

### Deployment

Create a Heroku application, and install the [Phoenix Buildpacks](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static):

```
$ heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static
```

Then, deploy:

```
$ git push heroku master
```
